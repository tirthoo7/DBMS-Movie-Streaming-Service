# DBMS-Movie-Streaming-Service
It is a Pure Database Project in which I have Included over a 100 Movie Details.
Functionality includes User can log in and purchase a movie to stream on their device for a given period of time. The user also gets a notification email before 5 days about expiring information.
All Functionality is implemented using Pl/SQL which will demonstrate all the PL/SQL Features like Cursor, Trigger, Event, View, etc.
Php_My_Admin is more preferable to run Pl/SQL Block easily.
Note: -Data used in tables are random data, which is generated by random data generator web sites.
